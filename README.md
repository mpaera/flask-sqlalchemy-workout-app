Workout Tracker API
A Flask + SQLAlchemy + Marshmallow backend API for tracking workouts and the exercises performed within them. Built for personal trainers to log workouts, maintain a reusable library of exercises, and record sets/reps/duration for each exercise performed in a given workout.
Description
This API manages three related resources:
Exercise — a reusable exercise (e.g. Push Up, Running) with a name, category, and whether equipment is needed.
Workout — a single workout session with a date, duration, and notes.
WorkoutExercise — a join resource linking a Workout to an Exercise, recording reps, sets, and/or duration for that exercise within that workout.
A Workout has many Exercises through WorkoutExercise, and an Exercise has many Workouts through WorkoutExercise, implemented with SQLAlchemy association proxies. Marshmallow schemas serialize nested relationships while avoiding infinite recursion by excluding circular back-references.
Validations
Table constraints: Exercise.name cannot be blank; Workout.duration_minutes must be greater than 0 (enforced at the database level).
Model validations: Exercise.category must be one of cardio, strength, flexibility, balance; Exercise.name cannot be empty/whitespace; Workout.duration_minutes must be a positive integer.
Schema validations: Exercise.name must have length >= 1; Exercise.category must be one of the allowed categories; Workout.duration_minutes must be >= 1.
